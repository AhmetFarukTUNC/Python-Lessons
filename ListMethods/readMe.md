# Description

## This script demonstrates various operations on lists in Python.

# Code Explanation

## - **List Creation**: A list named `List1` is created with a mix of integers, a string, and a float.

## - **Appending**: "Understandable Economy" is added to `List1` using the `append()` method.

## - **Inserting**: "I am Ahmet." is inserted at the second index of `List1` using the `insert()` method.

## - **Removing**: The value `2` is removed from `List1` using the `remove()` method.

## - **Popping**: The last element is removed from `List1` using the `pop()` method.
## - **Copying**: A copy of `List1` named `List2` is created using the `copy()` method.
## - **Extending**: The `numbers` list is extended with elements from the `letters` list using the `extend()` method.
## - **Counting**: The number of occurrences of `3` in the `numbers` list is counted using the `count()` method.
## - **Sorting**: The `numbers2` list is sorted in reverse order using the `sort()` method with `reverse=True`.
## - **Clearing**: The `numbers` list is cleared using the `clear()` method.
## - **Reversing**: The `cities` list is reversed using the `reverse()` method.
