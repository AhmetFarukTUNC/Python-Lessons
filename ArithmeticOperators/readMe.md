# What Is The Arithmatic Operators?

## Arithmetic operators are symbols used in mathematics to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. These operators are fundamental in mathematical calculations and programming languages. 
# Here's a list of common arithmetic operators:

## 1. Addition (+): Combines two values together.
## 2. Subtraction (-): Finds the difference between two values.
## 3. Multiplication (*): Multiplies two values together.
## 4. Division (/): Divides one value by another.
## 5. Exponentiation (** or ^): Raises a value to the power of another value.
## 6. Modulus (%): Finds the remainder after division of one value by another.

# These operators can be used to perform various calculations in mathematics and are essential in programming for numerical computations.
