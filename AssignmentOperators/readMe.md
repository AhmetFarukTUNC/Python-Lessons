# What Is The Assignment Operators?

## Assignment operators are used in programming languages to assign values to variables. They are typically used in conjunction with variables and literals to manipulate data within a program. In most programming languages, the basic assignment operator is represented by the equals sign (=).

# Here's a list of common assignment operators and their meanings:

## 1. **=** : Basic assignment operator. Assigns the value on the right-hand side to the variable on the

left-hand side.
   
## 2. **+=** : Adds the value on the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side and assigns the 

result to the variable.
   
## 3. **-=** : Subtracts the value on the right-hand side from the variable on the left-hand side and assigns the result to the variable.

## 4. ***=** : Multiplies the variable on the left-hand side by the value on the right-hand side and assigns the result to the variable.
   
## 5. **/=** : Divides the variable on the left-hand side by the value on the right-hand side and assigns the result to the variable.
  
## 6. **%=** : Computes the modulus of the variable on the left-hand side with the value on the right-hand side and assigns the result to the variable.

## 7. **//=** : Performs floor division on the variable on the left-hand side with the value on the right-hand side and assigns the result to the variable.

# These operators are commonly used in various programming languages such as Python, Java, C, C++, and many others to perform different operations while assigning values to variables.
