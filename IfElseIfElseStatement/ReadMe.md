# Login and Dollar Comparison

## This Python script performs a basic login authentication and compares yesterday's and today's dollar 

## rates, printing arrows to indicate the direction of change.

## Usage

### 1. Clone the repository:

#### git clone https://github.com/AhmetFarukTUNC/Python-Lessons/

### 2. Navigate to the directory:

### cd your_repository

#### Run the script:

##### python ifelseifelse.py

#### Follow the prompts to enter your username and password.

#### Authentication

##### If the username is "Understandable Economy" and the password is "1234567", it prints "Login is 

##### successful, welcome".
    
##### If the username is incorrect but the password is "1234567", it prints "Username is wrong".
    
##### If the username is "Understandable Economy" but the password is incorrect, it prints "Password is ##### wrong".
##### If both the username and password are incorrect, it prints "Username and password are wrong".

## Dollar Comparison

### The script compares yesterday's and today's dollar rates.
### If yesterday's rate is less than today's rate, it prints "increasing arrow".
### If yesterday's rate is greater than today's rate, it prints "decreasing arrow".
### If both rates are equal, it prints "equal arrow".
