# Simple Login System 

## This Python script demonstrates a simple login system where a user is prompted to enter a username and 

## password. If the provided credentials match the predefined default username and password, the user is 
## granted access; otherwise, they have limited attempts to log in before being denied access.

## Instructions:

### 1. **Run the Script:**

#### - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

#### - Open a terminal or command prompt.

#### - Navigate to the directory containing the script.

#### - Run the script by executing `cbExpression3.py`.

### 2. **Follow the Prompts:**

#### - You'll be prompted to enter a username and password.

#### - The default username is "Understandable Economy" and the default password is "123456".

#### - You have three attempts to log in with correct credentials.

### 3. **Outcome:**

#### - If you enter the correct username and password, you'll see "Login is success, welcome."

#### - If you enter incorrect credentials, you'll be informed about the remaining login attempts.

#### - After three unsuccessful attempts, you'll be denied access.

## Code Overview:

### - The code starts by initializing a counter to track the number of login attempts.

### - It then enters a loop that runs three times, allowing the user three attempts to log in.

### - Within each iteration of the loop:

### - The user is prompted to enter a username and password.

### - The entered credentials are compared with predefined default values.

### - If the credentials match, the user is granted access, and the loop breaks.

### - If the credentials are incorrect and attempts remain, the user is informed about the remaining 

### attempts.

### - If no attempts remain, the user is denied access.

## Files Included:

### - `cbExpressions3.py`: The Python script containing the login system code.

### - `README.md`: This file, providing instructions and an overview of the script.

## Modification:

### Feel free to modify the default username, password, or the number of login attempts as per your 

### requirements by changing the variables in the script.
