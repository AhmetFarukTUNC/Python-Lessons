# Understanding Understandable Character Array by `x`

## Description

### This Python script focuses on breaking down the string "Understandable Economy" into individual 

### characters until the first space character is encountered. It demonstrates a simple operation of 
### parsing a string character by character until a specified condition is met.

## Usage

### 1. **Installation Requirements:**

#### - Python 3.x installed on your system.

### 2. **Execution:**

#### - Save the provided Python script to your local machine with a `.py` extension as cbExpressions.py.

#### - Open a terminal or command prompt.

#### - Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.

#### - Run the script by typing `python cbExpressions.py`, where `cbExpressions.py` is the name of the 

#### saved script.

### 3. **Expected Output:**

#### - Upon running the script, it will print each character of the string "Understandable Economy" until 

#### the first space character is encountered. 

## Explanation

### - The variable `x` is assigned the string value "Understandable Economy".

### - The script iterates through each character in the string `x` using a `for` loop.

### - Inside the loop, it checks if the current character `i` is equal to a space character `" "`.

### - If a space character is encountered, the loop is terminated using the `break` statement.

### - Otherwise, the script prints the current character `i`.

### - Finally, the script effectively prints each character of the string until the first space character 

### is reached.

## Note

### - This script serves as a basic illustration of how to iterate through a string character by character 

### and terminate the loop based on a specific condition. It can be modified and extended for various text 

### parsing tasks and other applications as needed.

### - Ensure that Python is properly installed on your system and the script is executed in an environment 

### where Python is recognized.
