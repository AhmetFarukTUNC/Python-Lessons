### What Is The Type Conversion?

## In Python, "type conversion" refers to the process of changing the data type of an object from one type to another. Python provides built-in functions to perform these conversions.

## Here are some common type conversion functions in Python:

## int(): Converts a number or a string containing a whole number to an integer.

# x = int("123")

## float(): Converts a number or a string containing a decimal point to a floating-point number.

# y = float("3.14")

## str(): Converts an object to its string representation.

# z = str(42)

## list(): Converts a sequence (e.g., tuple, string) to a list.

# my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)

# my_list = list(my_tuple)

## tuple(): Converts a sequence (e.g., list, string) to a tuple.

# my_string = "hello"

# my_tuple = tuple(my_string)

### These are just a few examples, and there are more conversion functions available in Python. Type conversion is essential for handling different data types in a program and ensuring that operations are performed correctly.
