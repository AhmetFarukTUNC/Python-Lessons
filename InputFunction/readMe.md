# What Is the Input Function?

## In Python, the input() function is used to take input from the user through the keyboard. It reads input from the user as a string. The syntax for the input() function is simple:

### input(prompt)

## Here, prompt is an optional string parameter that can be used to display a message or prompt to the user before taking input. When the input() function is called, the program execution will halt until the user enters some input followed by pressing the "Enter" key. The input entered by the user is returned as a string, which can then be assigned to a variable for further processing.
