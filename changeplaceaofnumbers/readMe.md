# Variable Swapping

## This Python script demonstrates a 

## common programming technique known as 

## "variable swapping." It's a technique 

## used to exchange the values of two 

## variables without needing a third 

## temporary variable.

# Purpose

## The purpose of this script is to illustrate how to swap the values of two variables x and y using a temporary variable temp.
# How it Works

## Two variables x and y are initialized with the values 10 and 20 respectively.

## The current values of x and y are printed.


## A temporary variable temp is created and assigned the value of x.

## The value of y is assigned to x, effectively swapping the values.

## The value of temp (which holds the original value of x) is assigned to y.

## The final values of x and y are printed, demonstrating the swap.

# Running the Script

## To run the script, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, simply execute the script using a Python interpreter:

### python variable_swapping.py

# Notes

## This script serves as a basic demonstration of variable swapping.

## While a temporary variable is used here for clarity, Python provides a more concise way to swap variables without needing a temporary variable: x, y = y, x.
