# What Is The Dictionary?

In Python, dictionaries are data structures consisting of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are also referred to by the term "dictionary." With dictionaries, you can access values associated with a key and update these values. Dictionaries in Python are defined within curly braces {}, and key-value pairs are separated by commas.

# How Can I Do With Dictionary Structure?

1.)Indexing and Access: In dictionaries, you can quickly access values using keys. For example, the expression dictionary['key1'] will return the value 'value1'.

2.)Mutability: Dictionaries allow you to modify values and add new key-value pairs.

3.)Various Data Types: Python dictionaries can include different data types as keys and values. For instance, a key can be a string, and the corresponding value can be a number.

4.)Dynamic Length: Dictionaries permit dynamic changes, such as adding or removing elements.
