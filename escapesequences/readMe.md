# Explanation of Code Snippets

## Code Snippet 1

### print("Ahmet said 'I am very tired'.")

#### This line prints the string "Ahmet said 'I am very tired'." Notice that the single quotes around "I

#### am very tired" are printed as is because they are enclosed within double quotes.

## Code Snippet 2

### print("Ahmet said \"I am very tired\".")

#### This line also prints the same string as the previous line. Here, you've used escape characters (\")

#### to include double quotes within a string that is already enclosed in double quotes.

## Code Snippet 4

### print("Hi!\nMy name is understandable economy.\nWhat is your name?")

#### This line prints a greeting followed by a statement about your name and a question, each on a new #### line due to the \n escape character.

## Code Snippet 5

### print("\tHi!How are you?")

#### This line prints "Hi!How are you?" preceded by a tab character (\t). However, you mentioned it adds 5 or 6 characters, which might be because the tab character is expanding differently in different environments or when copied to different editors. If you need consistency in the formatting, you might consider using spaces instead of tabs.

## Feel free to adjust the formatting or content as needed!
