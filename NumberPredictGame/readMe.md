# Number Guessing Game

## This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and the user has to guess the number. The program provides feedback to the user whether their guess is too high or too low. The user has a limited number of guesses.

## How to Use

### 1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
### 2. Clone this repository or download the `predictgame.py` file.

### 4. Run the script by typing `python predictgame.py` and hitting Enter.
### 5. Follow the instructions provided by the program to input your guesses.

## Gameplay

### - You have a total of 10 guesses to find the correct number.
### - After each guess, the program will inform you whether the correct number is higher or lower than your guess.
### - If you guess the correct number within the allotted number of guesses, you win!
