# Sure, here's a simple README.md file explaining the purpose of the script and how to use it:

# Multiplication Script

## This Python script calculates the multiplication of numbers from 1 to 100 using a loop.

## Usage

### 1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the `for4.py` file.

### 3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `for4.

### py`.

### 4. Run the script by typing the following command:

#### python multiplication_script.py

#### 5. The script will calculate the multiplication of numbers from 1 to 100 and print the result.

## Explanation

### - The script initializes a variable `multiplication` with an initial value of 1.
### - It creates a range of numbers from 1 to 100 and assigns it to the variable `numbers`.
### - It then iterates through each number in the `numbers` range, multiplying it with the 
### `multiplication` variable.

### - Finally, it prints the result of the multiplication.
