# Calculate Rectangular Area Function

## This Python script defines a lambda function to calculate the area of a rectangle given its sides `a` and `b`. It demonstrates the usage of lambda functions and variable assignment.

## Usage

### To calculate the area of a rectangle:

#### calculateRectangularArea = lambda a, b: a * b / 2

##### This lambda function takes two arguments a and b, representing the lengths of the rectangle's sides. It returns the calculated area, which is a * b / 2.

## Example usage:

### print(calculateRectangularArea(3, 6))  # Output: 9.0

#### This will print the area of a rectangle with sides 3 and 6.

## Function Assignment

### You can also assign the lambda function to another variable, as shown below:

#### x = calculateRectangularArea

### Now, x refers to the same lambda function as calculateRectangularArea.

### Example usage:

#### print(x(4, 5))  # Output: 10.0

#### This will print the area of a rectangle with sides 4 and 5.
## Type of Function

### To check the type of the calculateRectangularArea function, you can use the type() function:

#### print(type(calculateRectangularArea))  # Output: <class 'function'>

#### This will print the type of the function, which is <class 'function'>.
