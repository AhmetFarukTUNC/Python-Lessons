# Python Login Example

## This repository contains a simple Python script demonstrating a login operation using conditional 

## statements and other basic python script.

## Overview

### The Python script in this repository demonstrates two basic operations:

#### 1. Checking if a variable `x` is equal to 5.

#### 2. Performing a login operation using a predefined username and password.

## Usage

### 1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

#### git clone https://github.com/AhmetFarukTUNC/Python-Lessons

### 2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

#### like cd Desktop/PythonLessons


### 3. Run the Python script:

#### python ifelse.py


## Details

### Checking Variable Equality

#### The script first assigns a value of 5 to the variable `x`. It then checks if `x` is equal to 5 using 

#### an `if` statement. If `x` is equal to 5, it prints "Yes, x is equal to 5." Otherwise, it prints "No, 

#### x is not equal to 5."

### Login Operation

#### The script defines a username and password. It then checks if the username is "Understandable 

#### Economy" and the password is "12345678" using an `if` statement. If both conditions are met, it 

#### prints "Login is success." Otherwise, it prints "Login is not success."

## Modification

### You can modify the script to suit your specific requirements. For example, you can change the values ### of `x`, `username`, and `password`, or add additional conditions to the login operation.
