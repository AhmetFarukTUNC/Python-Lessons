# Comparison Operators in Python

## This Python script demonstrates the use of comparison operators in Python. Comparison operators are 

## used to compare values and determine the relationship between them. This README provides an overview of 

## the code and how to use it.

# Code Explanation

## The script contains examples of various comparison operators along with explanations:

## Less Than (<): Checks if the value on the left is less than the value on the right.

## Greater Than (>): Checks if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.

## Equal To (==): Checks if the values on both sides are equal.

## Not Equal To (!=): Checks if the values on both sides are not equal.

## Membership (in): Checks if a value is present in a sequence.

## Identity (is): Checks if two variables refer to the same object.

## Identity (is not): Checks if two variables do not refer to the same object.

# Running the Code

## To run the code, follow these steps:

### Make sure you have Python installed on your system.  

### Copy the code into a Python script file (like comparison_operators.py).

### Run the script using a Python interpreter:

### python comparison_operators.py

# Example Output

# The output of the script will demonstrate the results of each comparison operation.

# False
# True
# False
# True
# True
# 139989617972800 139989617974592
# False
# True
# True

# Note

## It's important to understand the difference between the == operator (which checks for equality of 
## values) and the is operator (which checks for identity).
