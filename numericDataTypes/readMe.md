# Python Code Snippets Explained

## Here are some Python code snippets along with explanations:

### print(2 + 2) # It prints the sum of 2 and 2.

### x = 2 # x is equal to 2.

### print(type(x)) # It prints the data type of x.

### print(type(x + 0.5)) # It prints the data type of the sum of x and 0.5. It returns float because the sum of x and 0.5 is equal to 2.5, so float.

### letter = "A"

### print(type(letter)) # It prints the data type of the letter variable. The data type of the letter variable is string (str).

### complexNumber = 2 + 3j

### print(type(complexNumber)) # It prints that the complex number variable is complex as data type.

### print(complexNumber.real) # It prints the real part of the value of the complex number.

### print(complexNumber.imag) # It prints the imaginary part of the value of the complex number.
