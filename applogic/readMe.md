# How Can Python Runs?

## Python code is executed by the Python interpreter, which is a program that reads and executes Python 

## code. When you write Python code in a `.py` file, you can execute it using the Python interpreter in a 

## few different ways:

## 1. **Command Line**: You can run Python scripts directly from the command line or terminal by invoking

## the Python interpreter followed by the name of the script. For example:

##    ```
##    python my_script.py
##    ```

## 2. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Many IDEs such as PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or IDLE 

## provide built-in support for running Python code. You can open your Python script in the IDE and use 
## the IDE's interface to run the script.

## 3. **Interactive Mode**: You can run Python code interactively in a Python shell or interpreter. This 

## allows you to enter Python code line by line and see the results immediately. You can start an 

## interactive Python session by simply typing `python` in your command line or terminal:

##    ```
##    python
##    ```

##    Then you can enter Python code directly:

##    ```
##    >>> print("Hello, World!")
##    ```

## 4. **Jupyter Notebooks**: Jupyter Notebooks are an interactive computing environment that allows you to 

## create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. You can 

## run Python code cells within a Jupyter Notebook and see the output inline.

# Regardless of how you choose to run Python code, the Python interpreter reads your code line by line, 
# interprets it, and executes the instructions accordingly. It then produces any output specified in the 
# code or displays errors if any occur.
