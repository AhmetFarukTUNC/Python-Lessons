# Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator

## This Python script calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input of height (in centimeters) 

## and weight (in kilograms). It then categorizes the BMI into different weight groups and provides 

## feedback to the user.

# Usage

## Run the script (conditionExamples2.py).
## Input your height in centimeters when prompted.
## Input your weight in kilograms when prompted.

# Functionality

## The script performs the following actions:

## Prints a welcome message to the user.
## Prompts the user to input their height and weight.
## Calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) using the formula: BMI = weight / (height^2), where height is in meters.
## Categorizes the BMI into different weight groups based on standard thresholds.
## Provides feedback to the user based on their BMI category.

# BMI Categories

## Underweight: BMI <= 18.5
## Normal Weight: 18.5 < BMI <= 24.9
## Overweight: 25 < BMI <= 29.9
## Obese: 30 < BMI <= 40
## Extremely Obese: BMI > 40

# Example

## Hello, Welcome to Body Mass App...
## Please, Input your size as centimeter: 175
## Please, Input your kilo as kilogram: 70
## Your body mass index is 22.86. You are in the normal weight group.

# Notes

## Ensure that you input your height and weight correctly.
## The BMI calculation assumes that height is provided in centimeters and weight in kilograms.
